# Traffic-Accident-Prediction

Goal of the project: to have a program which can determine the likely hood of an accident

Dataset information:
Traffic Accident Prediction Dataset

This dataset contains data designed to predict the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents based on various factors affecting road conditions, driver behavior, and traffic situations.

Features:

Weather: The impact of weather conditions on the likelihood of accidents.

    Clear: No adverse weather conditions.
    Rainy: Rainy conditions increase the chance of accidents.
    Foggy: Foggy conditions reduce visibility, increasing accident chances.
    Snowy: Snow can cause slippery roads and higher accident probability.
    Stormy: Stormy weather can create hazardous driving conditions.

Road_Type: The type of road, influencing the probability of accidents.

    Highway: High-speed roads with higher chances of severe accidents.
    City Road: Roads within city limits, typically with more traffic and lower speeds.
    Rural Road: Roads outside urban areas, often with fewer vehicles and lower speeds.
    Mountain Road: Roads with curves and elevation changes, increasing accident risk.

Time_of_Day: The time of day when the accident occurs.

    Morning: The period between sunrise and noon.
    Afternoon: The period between noon and evening.
    Evening: The period just before sunset.
    Night: The nighttime, often associated with reduced visibility and higher risk.

Traffic_Density: The level of traffic on the road.

    0: Low density (few vehicles).
    1: Moderate density.
    2: High density (many vehicles).

Speed_Limit: The maximum allowed speed on the road.

Number_of_Vehicles: The number of vehicles involved in the accident, ranging from 1 to 5.

Driver_Alcohol: Whether the driver consumed alcohol.

    0: No alcohol consumption.
    1: Alcohol consumption (which increases the likelihood of an accident).

Accident_Severity: The severity of the accident.

    Low: Minor accident.
    Moderate: Moderate accident with some damage or injuries.
    High: Severe accident with significant damage or injuries.

Road_Condition: The condition of the road surface.

    Dry: Dry roads with minimal risk.
    Wet: Wet roads due to rain, increasing the risk of accidents.
    Icy: Ice on the road, significantly increasing the risk of accidents.
    Under Construction: Roads under construction, which may have obstacles or poor road quality.

Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicle involved in the accident.

    Car: A regular passenger car.
    Truck: A large vehicle used for transporting goods.
    Motorcycle: A two-wheeled motor vehicle.
    Bus: A large vehicle used for public transportation.

Driver_Age: The age of the driver. Values range from 18 to 70 years old.

Driver_Experience: The years of experience the driver has. Values range from 0 to 50 years of experience.

Road_Light_Condition: The lighting conditions on the road.

    Daylight: Daytime, when visibility is typically good.
    Artificial Light: Road is illuminated with streetlights.
    No Light: Road is not illuminated, typically during the night in poorly lit areas.
